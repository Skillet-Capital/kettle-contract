# Kettle Lending and Marketplace Smart Contract

## Overview

The Kettle smart contract is a robust decentralized finance (DeFi) solution designed by diamondjim.eth to empower users with fixed-interest loans secured by ERC721 and ERC1155 assets. Leveraging blockchain technology, Kettle introduces a novel approach to lending and marketplace transactions, integrating advanced features such as fixed interest rates, installment-based repayments, and a built-in marketplace for seamless NFT trading.

### Key Features

#### Fixed Interest Loans

Kettle facilitates fixed interest loans, allowing borrowers to secure funds with confidence in a stable and predictable interest rate environment.

#### Installment-Based Repayments

Loans are structured with installment-based repayment plans, enabling borrowers to pay back borrowed funds gradually over a predetermined period.

#### Grace Period and Default Rate

To provide flexibility, Kettle incorporates a grace period feature, granting borrowers additional time to rectify missed installments. After the grace period, a default rate is applied to missed payments.

#### Built-In Marketplace

Kettle boasts a native marketplace, empowering users to effortlessly buy and sell ERC721 and ERC1155 assets directly through the smart contract. This integrated marketplace streamlines NFT transactions within the Kettle ecosystem.
